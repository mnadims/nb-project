Usage: iclones [OPTIONS]
  OPTIONS:
    -minblock         ...  (Default: 20)
                      Minimum length of identical token sequences that are used
                      to merge near-miss clones. If set to 0, only identical
                      clones are detected.

    -minclone         ...  (Default: 100)
                      Minimum length of clones measured in tokens.

    -transformers     ...  (Default: all)
                      Transformers of the token stream. Set to none to disable
                      all transformers or pass a comma separated list of these
                      transformers: comment, array, include, import, method

    -mapping          [goede, bazrafshan]  (Default: goede)
                      Mapping approach to map clones across versions.

    -log              ...
                      A file to log all messages to. Default: Don't log to a
                      file.

    -basepath         [absolute, relative]  (Default: absolute)
                      How to write the basepath for all detected clones into the
                      output file.

    -latepropagation  ...
                      Enables detection of late propagated changes. This mode
                      causes all data to be kept in memory and thus has high
                      memory consuption.

    -language         [java, c, c++, ada, python]  (Default: java)
                      The language of the source that are anaylzed.

    -outformat        [network, none, text, rcf, rcfplus, xml, ccfl]  (Default: text)
                      Format used for writing clone data.

    -rpath            ...
                      Relevant project of input directory.

    -output           ...
                      Destination for writing the clone data.

    -input            ...
                      Determines from where sources and change information is
                      read.

    -regex            ...
                      File with regular expressions for modifying token
                      sequences prior to clone detection.

    -gitbranch        ...  (Default: master)
                      Branch of the Git repository to be analyzed.

    -informat         [single, directory, network, svn, git]  (Default: single)
                      The input format of the sources. This parameter determines
                      how the value passed to parameter 'input' is interpreted.
                      Use 'single' for single-version clone detection and
                      'directory' for incremental clone detection.

    -until            ...
                      Date or revision number of last revision to be analyzed.

    -interval         ...
                      Number of days between revisions(0 for each revision).

    -config           ...
                      The config file with the parameters to use. Command line
                      arguments overwrite settings in the config file.

    -since            ...
                      Date or revision number of first revision to be analyzed.
